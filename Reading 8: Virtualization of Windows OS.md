### What is an ISO File?
Often known as an ISO image, an ISO file is a single file that's a perfect representation of an entire CD, DVD, or BD. 
The entire contents of a disc can be precisely duplicated in a single ISO file.

### How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)?
For an ISO file to be used, it must be burned into a CD, DVD, or BD. 

### How do you create an ISO file?
Several third-party softwares can be used to bundle files into an ISO file that can be easily transported for use. 

### How do you mount an ISO file?
Mounting an ISO file is like tricking the computer into thinking that the ISO file is a real disc. This way, you can "use" an ISO file without having to burn it to a disc. 
Several programs can allow you to mount the iso file to a disk drive. Modern versions of Windows have feature built in to make this as simple as right clicking the iso image file.
