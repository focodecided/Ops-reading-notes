# Startup Sequences and BIOS
## What is the BIOS?
The BIOS is Basic Input Output System in the ROM of the motherboard. Its function is to initiate and load the operating system. 

## Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
For me, during the payroll cycle as in the booting process, I act as the BIOS. I initiate the process in our payment systems. I use basic information I already have in my system or knowledge as is in the ROM. 
But I don't have all the information for each worker, such as their hours and times. Therefore, I call my supervisor. She is the CMOS; she has those information. 

## What is the Power On Self Test (POST)?
The POST is the self test that the computer conducts to check if major components such as the CPU, RAM, and SSDs are working properly.

## What is the CMOS?
The CMOS is anon-volatile RAM that provides basic information to the BIOS during the booting process. 

## What is the CMOS battery?
The CMOS battery is a dedicated battery for the CMOS. It allows the CMOS to retain information even when the computer is turned off.
