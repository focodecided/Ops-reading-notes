### Why is this topic important?
- For IT professionals, developers, and power users, having strong command line skills allows more control, flexibility, and productivity than working solely in graphical interfaces. Mastering the command line unlocks advanced functionality, allows remote management, and is essential for unlocking the full power and potential of a computer system.

### 1. How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt?
- On the Windows command prompt, you can use the 'dir' command to list the files in the current directory. For example, 'dir' or 'dir /b' would list the file and folder names.

### 2. How might the “sfc” command and the “gpupdate” command help in troubleshooting on Windows?
- The 'sfc' (System File Checker) command can scan for and restore corrupted system files by comparing to a cache. 'gpupdate' forces an update of group policy settings, which can fix issues caused by outdated policies. Both can help troubleshoot Windows problems.

### 3. What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?
- 'robocopy' has more options for controlling copies than 'xcopy', like being able to resume interrupted copies and retry failed copies. This makes it useful for large or sensitive file transfers where you want more reliability.

### 4. Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.
- In a business environment, command line tools could help IT admins efficiently manage many devices. For example, using PowerShell scripts to check systems for policy compliance, or using 'robocopy' to sync files across multiple servers. For developers, Git and other CLI tools are commonly used to manage source code.
