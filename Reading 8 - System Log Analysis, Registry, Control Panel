### What is the Windows Registry, and what does it store?
- The Windows Registry is a centralized database that stores configuration settings and options for the operating system, hardware, software, and user preferences.

### What are the two types of registry settings stored for each Windows user account?
- The two types of registry settings for each user account are HKEY_CURRENT_USER which stores individual user settings, and HKEY_USERS which stores all user profiles on the machine.

### What are “registry hacks” and why might someone want to use them?
- "Registry hacks" refers to making changes or tweaks to registry settings to alter some aspect of a program or Windows' behavior beyond the normal options. People may want to enable hidden features, workarounds, or customizations.

### What are some common tasks you can perform by editing the Windows Registry?
- Common registry editing tasks include customizing Windows UI elements, changing file associations, managing startup programs, altering security settings, uninstalling devices, and enabling power user tweaks.

### Imagine you’re explaining the concept of the Windows Registry to someone who has never used a computer before. How would you make this explanation culturally relevant and relatable to their life experiences or background?
- I would explain the registry like a giant settings panel for Windows, much like the settings app on a smartphone. It stores all the configurations that control how Windows looks and behaves. I would relate editing the registry to tweaking expert settings on apps to customize them further to someone's personal preferences. I would caution that the registry editor is powerful and warn against indiscriminate changes.
